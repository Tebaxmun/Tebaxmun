I am a Software Engineer student, I'm currently learning HTML (really basic, I know) because I love to have cute profiles on my social media and have them as personalized as I can 😅. I'm really passionate about learning as much as I can to create new ideas and bringing them to life ✨

* **I am interested in Web designing, Android development, and learning a little bit about everything 🤩**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
 
  - HTML5
  - Java
  - React js

- 🤓 I’m looking forward to discover interesting codes on GitHub and learn from them as much as I can.

- 📖 I love to read romantic novels (mostly homoromantic ones), some horror novels as well and a little bit of history drama.
- 🎵 I love listening to music, that's why I decided to learn how to play the guitar (I'm not so bad at it right not, but definetly not a pro guitarist either, lol)
- 🖥️ Also, I reeeally love the old web aesthetics, so if you ever encounter some of my profiles, you might be able to notice that they have a bunch of blinkies and some other really nostalgic stuff (at least for me).
